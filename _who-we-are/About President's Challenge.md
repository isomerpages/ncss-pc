<p>The President’s Challenge was launched in 2000 by then-President Mr S
R Nathan, to rally Singaporeans to build a more caring and cohesive society,
and to help the less fortunate.</p>
<p>It has since supported many organisations, including those providing support
for disadvantaged children and families, the elderly in need of care, persons
with disabilities, and ex-offenders.</p>
<p>In September 2024, the President’s Challenge was refreshed with the aim,
of going beyond meeting immediate needs to achieve sustained social impact&nbsp;and
uplift the aspirations, abilities and potential of those who face greater
odds. It also extended its focus, to include the arts and sports as fields
for nurturing budding talents and sustaining their development.</p>
<p>By working in concert with other funding platforms, public and philanthropic,
the President’s Challenge seeks to also grow a broader environment of social
initiative in Singapore, for years to come.</p>
