President's Challenge would not be where we are today without the strong support of our donors and partners. Your donations will help our benefitting agencies to sustain their services in caring for those in need within our community.

As part of Singapore’s journey towards becoming a Smart Nation, PC will move towards digital payments. We will no longer be accepting cheque and cash payments for donations with effect from **1 January 2024**.

Your support and partnership in uplifting the Singapore communities in need remain important to us, and please make use of our online payment options, a seamless process for you to donate conveniently 

100% of the donations raised through President's Challenge will be channelled to the benefitting organisations across various sectors including children with special needs, persons with disabilities, healthcare and families and elderly in need. 

Once again, we thank you for your unwavering support.
