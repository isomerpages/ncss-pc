<p>Initiated by former President S R Nathan in 2000, President's Challenge
represents the coming together of people from all walks of life to help
the less fortunate. In 2012, under the leadership of President Tony Tan
Keng Yam, President's Challenge was expanded to go beyond fundraising,
by including volunteerism and social entrepreneurship.</p>
<p>In 2015, Dr Tony Tan launched the President’s Challenge Silver Volunteer
Fund, a fund which aims to encourage seniors to volunteer their time and
age actively. Donations help charities supported by the fund to curate
new or expand existing volunteer programmes, recruit volunteers through
volunteer management systems, and train and recognise volunteers. President’s
Challenge hopes to raise $10 million out of the $40 million needed by 2019
and the Silver Volunteer Fund aims to recruit an additional 50,000 senior
volunteers by 2030.</p>
<p>In 2018, President Halimah Yacob announced the new <a href="/empowering-for-life-fund/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">Empowering for Life Fund (ELF)</a>, a
fund supporting vulnerable groups through skills upgrading, capacity-building
and employment. ELF will focus on supporting customised, dedicated services
to the most vulnerable groups and facilitate their integration into society.
The programmes that it funds will handhold the most disadvantaged people
on their journeys to improve their circumstances. The aim is to help them
bounce back quickly from setbacks and stay adaptable.</p>
<p>Every dollar donated to President’s Challenge goes directly to the benefitting
organisations, thanks to our Challenge sponsors Singapore Pools and Singapore
Totalisator Board, which provide grants to cover the operating costs of
President’s Challenge.
