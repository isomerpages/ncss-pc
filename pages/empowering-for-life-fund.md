<p>President’s Challenge aims to help disadvantaged groups change their circumstances
and bring about more sustained changes to the lives of those we impact.
The President’s Challenge Empowering for Life Fund will fund programmes
to help the less fortunate, in the areas of skills upgrading, capacity-building
and employment.</p>
<p>It will focus on supporting customised, dedicated services to the most
vulnerable groups, and facilitate their integration into society. The programmes
that it fund will handhold the most disadvantaged families bounce back
quickly from setbacks and stay adaptable.</p>
