<p>President's Challenge would not be where we are today without the strong
support of our donors and partners. Your donations will help our benefitting
organisations to sustain their services in caring for those in need within
our community.</p>
<p>As part of Singapore’s journey towards becoming a Smart Nation, President’s
Challenge will move towards digital payments. We will no longer be accepting
cheque and cash payments for donations with effect from <strong>1 January 2024</strong>.</p>
<p>Your support and partnership in uplifting the Singapore communities in
need remain important to us, and please make use of our online payment
options, a seamless process for you to donate conveniently.</p>
<p>100% of the donations raised through President's Challenge will be channelled
to the benefitting organisations across various sectors including children
with special needs, persons with disabilities, healthcare and families
and elderly in need.</p>
<p>Once again, we thank you for your unwavering support.</p>
