<p>The President’s Challenge seeks to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Develop talents and abilities</strong> in every field, especially
among those facing disadvantage. This includes the <strong>arts and sports</strong> as
fields for nurturing potential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Provide sustained funding</strong> for beneficiary organisations,
typically from three to five years, to help achieve better and more lasting <strong>social impact</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In 2025, the President’s Challenge will support 60 programmes from 52
organisations. Here are some selected supported programmes and their beneficiaries.</p>

<h4>Nur Syahidah Alim, Para Archer</h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">

</div>
<p>Nur Syahidah Alim was born with diplegia, a form of cerebral palsy marked
by stiff lower limbs that results in difficulty walking or standing for
extended periods of time. But the physical challenges were just the tip
of the iceberg. She was constantly bullied and ostracised In school due
to her condition, which prevented her from taking part in sports activities
with her peers.</p>
<p>However, it was Syahidah who demonstrated the grit and determination of
a true athlete. With support from organisations like the Singapore Disability
Sports Council (SDSC), she has become a world champion para archer and
multiple gold medallist who has represented Singapore at the ASEAN PARA
GAMES, Paralympic Games and the World Archery Para Championships.</p>
<p>There are many more talented individuals like Syahidah just waiting to
achieve their potential. Join us in supporting their growth by <a href="https://donate.stripe.com/00gcQzevAcvq47e4gy" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">donating to the President's Challenge</a> today.</p>

<h4>Reuel Dylan Tan, Artist with Autism</h4>
<p></p>
<div class="isomer-image-wrapper">
<img style="width: 100%" height="auto" width="100%" alt="Reuel Dylan Tan" src="/images/User/Reuel_Dylan_Tan.jpg">
</div>
<p>Reuel was just two years old when his family members noticed something
odd: he avoided eye contract with almost everyone. Sensing something amiss,
Reuel’s Mum brought him for a checkup. Reuel was diagnosed with autism
and as he grew older, he exhibited more signs, such as outbursts and difficulty
interacting with others.</p>
<p>Then something unexpected occurred. During the Covid lockdown when Reuel
was 13, his parents bought him a paint-by-numbers set to keep him occupied
while the family was cooped up at home. Each resulting artwork was better
than the last, demonstrating Reuel’s intuitive grasp of colours. He soon
“graduated” to starting with a blank canvas, then he went on to expand
his skillsets by watching YouTube videos.</p>
<p>Reuel’s therapists at Extra•Ordinary People – which holistically supports
persons with special needs – recognised his talent immediately and gave
him the opportunity to flourish at Creative Lab, their in-house vocational
arts incubator for emerging artists with disabilities.</p>
<p>Today, self-taught Reuel is an accomplished still life and landscape painter
whose highly detailed paintings have been purchased by private corporations.
He was also recently commissioned by the Crowne Plaza Penang Straits City
Hotel to paint two artworks for their premises.</p>
<p>Painting is now Reuel’s purpose in life. Now let’s make it our purpose
to ensure he achieves his full potential. Join us in supporting talented
individuals like Reuel. <a href="https://donate.stripe.com/00gcQzevAcvq47e4gy" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">Donate to the President's Challenge today.</a>
