<li>
<p><strong>How much tax deductions do I qualify for when I make a donation?</strong>
<br>All outright cash donations given by individuals or corporations to charities
with tax-deductible status will be entitled to tax deductions. It was announced
in Budget 2023 that the 250% tax deduction for qualifying donations will
be extended for another two years till 31 December 2026. For more information
on tax deductions, visit <a href="https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/default.aspx" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">www.iras.gov.sg.</a>

<li>
<p><strong>Will I receive a tax-deductible receipt for my donation?</strong>
<br>e-Tax Deductible Receipts will be issued upon request. Regardless of your
donation amount, we will help to submit your tax deduction to IRAS as long
as you provide your Singapore identification number or UEN when donating.
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>How do I claim for my tax deductions without a tax-deductible receipt?</strong>
<br>If you have provided your identification number when you made a donation
to President’s Challenge, we will help you make the submission to IRAS.
Hence, you will not need the receipt when submitting your annual tax assessment.
If you are an individual donor, IRAS now automatically acknowledges the
tax-deductible status of your donations if the charity submits your identification
number to IRAS on your behalf.
<br>
<br>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Will my organisation receive a tax deduction or does each of us get individual tax deductions for our donation?</strong>
<br>If the donation was made on your organisation’s behalf, your company will
qualify for tax deduction. Individual donors get the tax deduction if the
individual donor’s donation was from a fundraising event or exercise. In
such a case, your organisation will only receive a receipt of acknowledgement
for the contribution.

</li>
<li>
