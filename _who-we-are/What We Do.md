<p>President’s Challenge (PC) was introduced in 2000, by then-President Mr
S R Nathan. Since its inception, President’s Challenge has provided benefits
to many organisations and individuals over the years. Over the last two
decades, we have also witnessed the significant growth of government and
philanthropic initiatives to support groups in need.</p>
<p>To ensure that the benefits of President’s Challenge reach even more Singaporeans,
President’s Challenge is being repositioned and repurposed. The refreshed
President’s Challenge will reposition its role within the broader landscape
of giving. It will aim to achieve sustained social impact, in particular
in enabling people of all abilities and backgrounds to develop their potential.</p>
<p>While supporting social impact initiatives will remain a key focus of
President’s Challenge, from 2025 onwards, President’s Challenge will broaden
its scope to nurture talent and aspirations in the arts and sports, including
among disadvantaged groups, effectively supporting the aspirations of individuals
from all walks of life.</p>
<p>It will also expand and deepen partnerships with public and philanthropic
organisations that may lead initiatives consistent with the President’s
Challenge’s goals and principles.</p>
<p>The refresh will help ensure President’s Challenge remains purpose-driven
and impact-oriented, complementing existing initiatives in the public and
private sector to foster a culture of unity and respect for all.</p>
