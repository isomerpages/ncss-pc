<p>The refreshed President’s Challenge seeks to build a culture of unity
and respect for all, by uplifting the aspirations, abilities and potential
of all, especially those who start with greater odds.</p>
<p>As part of this effort, the President’s Challenge will introduce Fellowships
to develop civic leaders, recognise individuals pursuing second chances
in life, as well as encourage new innovations and initiatives in the social
services sector.</p>
