<p>Every year, supporters of President’s Challenge, people from all walks
of life pull together their resources to organise big- to small-scale fundraising
events to raise funds for President’s Challenge’s benefiting organisations.
This is how the community is making a collective effort towards building
a cohesive and caring society.</p>

<p>The President's Challenge is a movement supported by the kindness and
generosity of people from all walks of life, regardless of culture, religion
or family background, to help those less fortunate. We are proud to share
this video of the President's Challenge 2019, showing how Singaporeans
come together to show love, care &amp; support to build a more caring &amp;
inclusive society.</p>
