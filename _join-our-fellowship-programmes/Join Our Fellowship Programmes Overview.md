<p>The refreshed President’s Challenge aims to foster a culture of unity
and respect by empowering individuals, especially those facing greater
challenges to realise their full potential.</p>
<p>As part of this mission, we are launching three President’s Challenge
Fellowship programmes to nurture civic leadership, support individuals
embracing second chances, and bring sustainable impact to the community.
Through these tracks, individuals from diverse backgrounds will have opportunities
to develop their capabilities, with support in the form of mentorships,
work placements and awards.</p>
