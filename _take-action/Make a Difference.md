<p>The President’s Challenge is in service of the&nbsp;more inclusive and
vibrant social compact we are developing in Singapore – one that motivates
everyone to realise their fullest potential, and values the many ways in
which we each contribute to society.</p>
<p>From 2025, the President’s Challenge was refreshed to focus on achieving
more <strong>sustained social impact</strong>, in particular, by uplifting
aspirations, abilities, and potential among those facing disadvantage.
To support this, it has adopted a <strong>longer-term funding</strong> model,
enabling supported projects to deliver deeper and more lasting impact.</p>
<p>The President’s Challenge is enabled by the generosity of donors, volunteers,
and the broader community that shares its goals. We are also working actively
with partners – drawing on their networks and capabilities – to help build
a broader community of giving and mutual uplift.</p>
<p><strong>Whether through volunteering, donations, or partnerships, each of us has a role in supporting the causes that the President’s Challenge espouses.</strong>
