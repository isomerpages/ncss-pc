<p>President’s Challenge (PC) was introduced in 2000, by then-President Mr
S R Nathan. Since its inception, PC has provided benefits to many organisations
and individuals over the years. Over the last two decades, we have also
witnessed the significant growth of government and philanthropic initiatives
to support groups in need.</p>
<p>To ensure that the benefits of PC reach even more Singaporeans, PC is
being repositioned and repurposed. The refreshed PC will reposition its
role within the broader landscape of giving. It will aim to achieve sustained
social impact, in particular in enabling people of all abilities and backgrounds
to develop their potential.</p>
<p>While supporting social impact initiatives will remain a key focus of
PC, from 2025 onwards, PC will broaden its scope to nurture talent and
aspirations in the arts and sports, including among disadvantaged groups,
effectively supporting the aspirations of individuals from all walks of
life.</p>
<p>It will also expand and deepen partnerships with public and philanthropic
organisations that may lead initiatives consistent with the PC’s goals
and principles.</p>
<p>The refresh will help ensure PC remains purpose-driven and impact-oriented,
complementing existing initiatives in the public and private sector to
foster a culture of unity and respect for all.</p>
