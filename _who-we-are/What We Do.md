<p>President’s Challenge was introduced in 2000, by then-President Mr S R
Nathan. Since its inception, President’s Challenge has provided benefits
to many organisations and individuals over the years. Over the last two
decades, we have also witnessed the significant growth of government and
philanthropic initiatives to support groups in need.</p>
<p>These positive developments have created a broader landscape of giving
and volunteerism. It is timely for President’s Challenge to be refreshed
and repositioned in its purpose, and in how it seeks to achieve its goals
from 2025.</p>
<p>The refreshed President’s Challenge aims to build a culture of unity and
respect for all, by supporting aspirations and recognising contributions
by all. It will aim to achieve sustained social impact,&nbsp;by uplifting
the aspirations, abilities and potential of those who start with greater
odds.</p>
<p>The President’s Challenge will also extend its focus to include the Arts
and Sports as fields for nurturing potential, including among disadvantaged
groups, and to enable budding talents to sustain their development.</p>
<p>It will also expand and deepen partnerships with public and philanthropic
organisations that may lead initiatives consistent with the President’s
Challenge’s goals and principles.</p>
<p>The refresh will help ensure President’s Challenge remains purpose-driven
and impact-oriented, while working in concert with other funding platforms,
public and philanthropic, to seek to grow a broader environment of social
initiative.</p>
