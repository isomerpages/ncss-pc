<p>The President’s Challenge was launched in 2000 by then-President Mr S
R Nathan, to rally Singaporeans to build a more caring and cohesive society,
and to help the less fortunate.</p>
<p>It has since supported many organisations, including those providing support
for disadvantaged children and families, the elderly in need of care, persons
with disabilities, and ex-offenders.</p>
<p>In September 2024, the President’s Challenge was refreshed with the aim,
of going beyond meeting immediate needs to achieve sustained social impact
and uplift the aspirations, abilities and potential of individuals and
communities, particularly those who start with greater odds. It also aims
to widen the chances and opportunities for arts and sports talents to be
nurtured, and for their development to be sustained.</p>
<p>President’s Challenge will support projects at varying stages of development,
ranging from pilot projects trying out innovative solutions, to established
projects with strong outcomes that need additional support to scale for
greater impact.</p>
<p>By working in concert with other funding platforms, public and philanthropic,
the President’s Challenge seeks to also grow a broader environment of social
initiative in Singapore, for years to come.</p>
