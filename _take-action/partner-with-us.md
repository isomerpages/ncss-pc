<p>Every year, supporters of President’s Challenge —people from all walks
of life— regardless of culture, religion or family background, pull together
their resources to organise big to small-scale fundraising events to raise
funds for President’s Challenge’s benefitting organisations. This is how
the community is making a collective effort towards building a cohesive
and caring society.</p>
<p>If you are interested in organising a fundraising event in support of
President’s Challenge, email us at <a href="mailto:pc_enquiry@ncss.gov.sg" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">pc_enquiry@ncss.gov.sg.</a>
