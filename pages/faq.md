### **FAQ**

#### **DONATIONS**
 
##### 1. What percentage of my donation goes to the charities supported by President’s Challenge?  
100% of donations to President's Challenge go towards the supported charities chosen by the President’s Challenge.  

##### 2. Who covers the operating costs of President's Challenge?  
The operating costs of President’s Challenge are covered by a grant from Singapore Totalisator Board as a community initiative so that every dollar donated to President's Challenge go to the charities we support. 

##### 3. How can I be an anonymous donor?  
Let us know your request to remain anonymous and we will respect your request. 

##### 4. How much tax deductions do I qualify for when I make a donation? 
All outright cash donations given by individuals or corporations to charities with tax-deductible status will be entitled to tax deductions. From 1 January 2016 to 31 December 2018, donors are entitled to 250% tax deduction for qualifying donations. Therefore, if you give $100 to a charity, you will be entitled to tax deduction for the amount of $250. For more information on tax deductions, visit [www.iras.gov.sg](https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/default.aspx)

##### 5. Will I receive a tax deductible receipt for my donation? 
In support of green efforts to save the environment, we will not be issuing any receipts for donation unless upon request. Regardless of your donation amount, we will help to submit your tax deduction to IRAS as long as you provide your Singapore identification number when making a donation. 

##### 6. How do I claim for my tax deductions without a tax deductible receipt? 
If you have provided your identification number when you made a donation to President’s Challenge, we will help you make the submission to IRAS. Hence, you will not need the receipt when submitting your annual tax assessment. If you are an individual donor, IRAS now automatically acknowledges the tax-deductible status of your donations if the charity submits your identification number to IRAS on your behalf. 

##### 7. Will my organisation receive a tax deduction or does each of us get individual tax deductions for our donation? 
If the donation was made on your organisation’s behalf, your company will qualify for tax deduction. Individual donors get the tax deduction if the individual donor’s donation was from a fundraising event or exercise. In such a case, your organisation will only receive a receipt of acknowledgement for the contribution. 

##### 8. Does President’s Challenge sell, rent or trade donor information (eg. mailing and email addresses and phone numbers) to other agencies? 
The privacy of our donors is very important to us and we do not share or sell this information.

##### 15. Are agencies allowed to fund-raise for their programmes that are supported by PC-ELF?
Yes, Agencies can fund-raise for any shortfall/components of the programme not covered by PC-ELF funding.

##### 16. What are the reporting requirements of PC-ELF?
