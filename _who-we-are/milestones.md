<p>The late S R Nathan initiated President’s Challenge in 2000 shortly after
assuming the Presidency. The social service sector was always something
very close to his heart and he decided to help raise funds for this sector
and place a spotlight on those in need. When Mr Nathan stepped down from
office after 12 years as President of Singapore, the movement he started
had raised more than $100 million and benefitted more than 500 programmes
in social service organisations that reach out to needy children, families,
seniors, disabled and other social service endeavours.</p>

<p>President Tony Tan Keng Yam continued President’s Challenge in 2012. He
announced his plans to expand the scope of President’s Challenge beyond
fundraising. Two initiatives were shared – the President’s Challenge Volunteer
Drive and the President’s Challenge Social Enterprise Award. These new
initiatives encourage people from all walks of life to not only give money
but to also give their time and talent, using their business skills to
help the less fortunate.</p>

<p>President’s Challenge celebrated its 15th anniversary on March 2015 at
the <strong>President’s Challenge 15th Anniversary Commemorative Dinner</strong> held
at the Istana. During the event, President Tony Tan recognised 32 organisations
and individuals who made special contributions to the causes supported
by President’s Challenge through the years. Dr Tan also highlighted the
importance of establishing a strong community in nation-building. President’s
Challenge would now seek to play a bigger role in nurturing stronger communities
by expanding support for programmes beyond the social service sector and
to encourage all ages to get involved in community work.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>On September 2015, Dr Tan initiated the <strong>President’s Challenge Silver Volunteer Fund</strong>,
which supports beneficiary organisations by building up their capabilities
so they can boost senior volunteerism and encourage seniors to stay active
in their communities. President’s Challenge will be raising part of the
$40 million fund needed to recruit an additional 50,000 senior volunteers
by 2030.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>In 2015, President’s Challenge with the support from the Early Childhood
Development Agency (ECDA) initiated the <strong>“Start Small Dream Big”</strong> project
to inculcate positive values in pre-schoolers and encourage them to give
back to society. Through community service projects, over 62,000 children
have participated in the annual project and raised more than $450,000 since
the project’s inception.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>In the same year, the <strong>National Council of Social Service (NCSS)</strong> took
over the function of President's Challenge Secretariat and oversees the
secretariat duties, fundraising efforts and volunteerism drive under President's
Challenge. The Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of Social and Family
Development (MSF) and Principal Private Secretary to the President continued
as co-chairs of the President's Challenge Steering Committee.</p>

<p>Over the past 17 years, the President’s Challenge focus has been on creating
a culture of giving, not just in monetary sense but also in time and skills.
These efforts are important and should continue but as the social service
landscape in Singapore changes, President’s Challenge will also have to
evolve with the changing needs.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>Going forward, President Halimah Yacob hopes for Singaporeans to look
into more customised and upstream support, to be able to help the most
vulnerable amongst us and change their circumstances. As the old saying
goes, it is “better to teach one to fish than to merely give him a fish”.
Whether it is through skills upgrading, capacity-building or empowerment,
it is the President’s hope that together we can bring about more sustained
changes to the lives of those we impact.

<p>At the President's Challenge 2018 Launch, President Halimah Yacob announced
the new <strong>"Empowering for Life Fund" (ELF)</strong>, a fund supporting
vulnerable groups through skills upgrading, capacity-building and employment.
Donations to ELF will receive dollar-to-dollar matching from the Government.
This means that over the next five years, $20 million will be set aside
for ELF programmes under the President's Challenge.</p>
<p>ELF will focus on supporting customised, dedicated services to the most
vulnerable groups and facilitate their integration into society. The programmes
that it funds will handhold the most disadvantaged people on their journeys
to improve their circumstances. The aim is to help them bounce back quickly
from setbacks and stay adaptable.</p>

<p>President Halimah Yacob launched the President’s Challenge Enabling Employment
Pledge at the launch of PC2020 to rally employers to provide more employment
opportunities to persons with disabilities. The President’s Challenge Enabling
Employment Pledge calls on employers to adopt an inclusive mindset, create
barrier-free workplace environments and implement supportive employment
policies for employees with disabilities.</p>
<p>Through the Enabling Employment Pledge, President’s Challenge hopes to
encourage more employers to take the first step and open their doors to
persons with disabilities. Employers who sign the Pledge can look forward
to greater support in their effort to train, hire and integrate employees
with disabilities.</p>
