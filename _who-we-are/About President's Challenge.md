<h3><strong>A Quote from Our President</strong></h3>
<p><em>“The ultimate objective is something intangible. We're really developing a community of respect. It's intangible. It's a culture. But we're at the stage of our development as a country where the intangibles matter more in our own lives, and in national life. And they even matter in our being able to achieve our tangible goals.</em>
</p>
<p><em>Developing that community of respect – not just respecting our differences, but respecting the effort, skills, and contribution that every individual brings – is what creates unity. But its more than that. It's actually one of the most powerful ways in which we uplift ourselves.</em>
</p>
<p><em>We uplift people not just by financial resources, not just by opening up opportunities, but by helping them develop that intrinsic motivation to go further. And the respect we lend each other is the most powerful source of intrinsic motivation. Knowing that you can do it. Everyone can do it. That's how we rise together.”</em>
</p>
<p>— President Tharman Shanmugaratnam</p>

<h3><strong>About President’s Challenge</strong></h3>
<p>The President’s Challenge was launched in 2000 by then-President Mr S
R Nathan, to rally Singaporeans to build a more caring and cohesive society,
and to help our communities in need.</p>
<p>The President’s Challenge, refreshed from 2025, aims to promote a <strong>culture of</strong>  <strong>unity</strong> and <strong>respect for all</strong>.</p>
<p>It will do so by helping to <strong>uplift individuals from all backgrounds</strong> and
recognising contributions by all.</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>We will promote initiatives to develop <strong>talents and abilities in every field</strong>,
especially among those who have to <strong>overcome disadvantages or setbacks</strong>.
This will include the arts and sports as fields for nurturing potential.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In addition, we will introduce <a href="/join-our-fellowship-programmes/" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">President’s Challenge Fellowships</a> aimed
at developing<strong> civic leaders</strong> and recognising <strong>individuals pursuing second chances in life</strong>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Across these initiatives, we will seek to promote <strong>volunteerism, multiracialism, and cross-cultural appreciation</strong> as
a way of life.</p>
<p>The President’s Challenge will hence be at the service of the&nbsp;<strong>more inclusive and vibrant social compact</strong> that
we are developing in Singapore:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>One which motivates everyone to develop themselves to the fullest, and
recognises the different ways in which we all contribute to our nation.&nbsp;</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One that is shaped by the whole community and civic fabric.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>One that ultimately fosters a culture of respect for all, and brings us
closer together.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>To reflect the new identity of the President’s Challenge, a logo competition
was launched in early 2025, opened to students enrolled in our Polytechnics,
Institutes of Technical Education (ITE) and the University of the Arts
Singapore. The competition drew 153 entries. The winning design by Xandrea
Alfie Isa from Temasek Polytechnic will be the new logo of the President’s
Challenge.</p>
<p>This logo, titled Guided by the Heart, is a thoughtfully designed symbol
that visually embodies the values of unity, empowerment, and upliftment.
At the heart of the design, the letters P and C are crafted into a continuous
loop, representing the unbreakable cycle of unity and inclusivity. Together,
the elements create a powerful and meaningful emblem that reflects a community
rising together, driven by heart and purpose.</p>
