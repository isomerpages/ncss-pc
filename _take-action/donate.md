<p>The President's Challenge would not be where we are today without the
strong support of our donors and partners. Your donations will help our
benefitting organisations sustain their ability to care for those in need
within our community.</p>

<p>As part of Singapore’s journey towards becoming a Smart Nation, the President’s
Challenge will move towards digital payments, we no longer accept cheque
and cash donations from 1 January 2024.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your support and partnership in uplifting the Singapore communities in
need remain important to us. Through the SG Gives matching grant, donations
made to the President’s Challenge will be matched by the Government up
to $250 million under the General and Enhancing Matching tiers from 1 January
2025 onwards.</p>
