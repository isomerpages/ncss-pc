<p>The President’s Challenge was launched in 2000 by then-President Mr S
R Nathan, to rally Singaporeans to build a more caring and cohesive society,
and to help our communities in need.
<br>
</p>
<p>It has since supported many organisations, including those providing support
for children with special needs and families who need support, the elderly
in need of care, persons with disabilities, and ex-offenders.
<br>
</p>
<p>In September 2024, the President’s Challenge was refreshed with the aim
of going beyond meeting immediate needs, to achieve sustained social impact
and uplift the aspirations, abilities and potential of individuals and
communities, particularly those who start with greater odds. It aims to
widen the chances and opportunities for arts and sports talents to be nurtured,
and for their development to be sustained, while also providing fellowship
programmes aimed at developing civic leaders and recognising individuals
pursuing second chances in life.</p>

<p>This refreshed President’s Challenge unveiled a new logo to reflect this
repositioning of its role within the broader landscape of giving. The new
logo – designed by Xandrea Alfie Isa from Temasek Polytechnic – was the
winning submission in the President’s Challenge Logo Design Competition
2025, which saw over a hundred logo design entries from IHL students across
Singapore.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Titled “Guided by the Heart”, Xandrea’s thoughtful creation visually embodies
the organisation’s purpose of building a culture of unity, empowerment
and upliftment. The letters “P” and “C” form a continuous loop, representing
the unbreakable cycle of unity and inclusivity.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This loop extends gracefully into an upward arrow signifying growth, progress
and the uplifting impact that the President’s Challenge strives to achieve
in communities. The arrowhead is heart-shaped, symbolising the compassion,
kindness and deep sense of purpose that guides the organisation.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Together, the elements create a powerful and meaningful emblem that reflects
a community rising together, driven by heart and purpose.
